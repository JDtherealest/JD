<p style="padding-left: 1cm">When it comes to sports I play for the competitiveness,my own ambition, and for memories and bonds.
As a kid I losing always hated losing whenever there was a prize involved. Growing up with  competitive siblings everything turned into a competition,
whether if its the most simplest tasks like see who can stay up the longest, to staring competitions, or harder stuff like seeing who has the more raw athleticism.
I play sport to set the bar when it come to my ambition of becoming rich, when I say setting the bar I mean never settling for the less like being the worst player 
on the team but to shoot for top. I play sports for the memories and bonds with friends, theres nothing like looking back on all the roasts and the memories of seeing each other cool stuff
on the courts or field.
