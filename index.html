My name is Jean David Hurd, I am Freshman at the University of Maine and a Brother of Theta Chi

where I graduated from Edward Little class of 2016. In high school I had a part in everything, 
from going to my brother's chorus concerts to wild'n out during spirit week, you name it I was probably there. 
But in high school I was mostly an athlete, I dedicated most of my time to sports.</p>
