<p style="padding-left: 1cm"> Basketball: I started playing basket in the 7th grade, I played the Shooting Guard/
Small Forward position. In middle school I wasn't really that good and end up getting cut from the team and ended up playing rec ball,
but that didn't stop me from not wanting to play it just push me to want to be better. So I used to go outside and work on the the little 
things and put them to the test in pickup games, then freshman year I eventually made the team but after that I was back to square one so I just played summer ball for the school.
When it comes to basketball I would say im more of athletic defensive type player because I have tremendous natural athleticism and my defense is better than my offense.
My favorit player to watch is Russell Westbrook </p>

<p style="padding-left: 1cm"> Football: Senior year I wanted to try something new so I picked up football and played for the team. I got tryout many different positions on defense,
but I mostly played Safety and some Nose Guard, I played safety because I was very fast and could cover a lot of ground in the fewest amount of seconds and I don't really know why
 I played Nose I didn't even have the size or the strength for the position but somehow I manage to hold my own, I find myself to be very elusive and I somehow always found a way to get through the offensive line.  
My favorite players are Julio Jones and Mike Vick. </p>

<p style="padding-left: 1cm"> Track: I started track in 7th grade, I wasn't really into it at first but if I wasn't for my middle school coach pestering me to join the team everyday 
and my name on the roster when track season came causing me to join instantly because I ain't no quitter, I probably wouldn't have never discovered the sport where I could put my raw athleticism to the test and eventually tune it into something more.
In track I mostly did all jumping events, 100m dash,110m hurdles, relays, and some mid distances (I dont know why I hate distance running) 300m hurdles. In track I would say I hated practices because they we always so boring and always changing,
so I never knew what to prepare for but as result I would have to say those practices made me pretty good. If I were to try to go D1 then track would be the key to getting me into being a D1 athlete. In high school I went to KVACs every year and
 went to states my junior year but didn't try go senior year cause I didn't want to be late  for my graduation and have to wear my uniform under my cap & gund, also senior year started to feel less fun and more like a chore cause my coach change dramatically that year.

<p style="padding-left: 1cm"> Baseball: I started baseball in the 2nd grade and played till sophomore  year in Little League. I played second base and mostly right field cause of my speed. During my years of little league I've won 3 championships
and made the All Star team once in 7th grade and went to states. I didn't play baseball in high school because it was during the same time as track season., but now that I look back on it I should have done both in high school.
 I've had some great memories playing with the boys like when I hit my first homerun, and have rap battles and roast offs in the dugout at practice.
